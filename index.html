            Since I was little I traveled with my family. That's how I discovered my passion for discovering new places on this earth.I love to visit new countries, meet people, learn and discover new cultures, cuisines, clothing styles.I have traveled so far in twelve wonderful countries, I liked them all in a certain way. I fell in love with something in everything.When I'm in a new country, I detach myself from everything, I live every second to the fullest, I don't want to lose or miss anything, I try new things, all without fear, I practically rediscover myself.I connect with the energy of every place I am. I love to try new foods, I am a gourmet and I love to eat. I dream of visiting this whole world or at least I will try and I hope I will succeed.

            One of my passions is photography, the image above is taken by me. I hope that in the near future this hobby will become a kind of part-time "job".I try to capture the most beautiful frames, for now the pictures are only taken with the phone, but soon I will also buy a camera.I take pictures of both landscapes and people. I try to capture everything that is my muse in its best moments, its frames. Practically everything behind my camera should radiate.I take pictures of everything, I also make vlogs but they are private, only for me and my close ones, but who knows, maybe soon it will be for all of you who discover me now reading these lines.

            The picture above is taken by me, the most loyal and loving earthling I know, he is Rocco, my beloved dog.Rocco came into my family last summer, after an unfortunate incident with one of my dogs. He is a Labrador Retriever, playful, loving and cuddly. Even if he doesn't know you, he loves you from the first time he sees you, he's a gourmet just like me. Our favorite activities together are: eating, watching movies, walking in nature, playing with the ball and relaxing on the lawn on a quiet day. Rocco is still a baby, he is only eight months old, but he grew up seeing with his eyes, he likes to go for car rides, stick his head out the window and bark at people, but he doesn't bark with malice but with love, basically Rocco greets everyone the world, and loves and is loyal to everyone. That's why I love him and last but not least, because he is my dog.
